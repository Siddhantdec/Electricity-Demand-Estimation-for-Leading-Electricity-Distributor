# Electricity-Demand-Estimation-for-Leading-Electricity-Distributor
It is basically a Univariate Time forecasting data.
Getting the accurate estimation of demand so that they can procure or produce the electricity according to the demand.
We have forecasted the demand of electricity for next 2 years based on the data given from 1973 to 2019.
We have used the STL (Seasonality Trend Loess ) technique, ETS (Exponential Smoothening technique) and the SARIMA model to predict the future demand estimation values.
For SARIMA models, we have focussed on making our time series data stationary using the ADF tests (Augmented Dickey Fuller tests).
We have provided the model validation metrics/ accuracy metrics.
